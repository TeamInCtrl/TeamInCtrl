### Hi there!
This is the shared Github account of the members of InCtrl (Team 490), based in the UK. This account is mainly used for documenting the progress of our robot.
Our aim is to inspire other young STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) enthusiasts, for them to be able to reach their goals and potentially revolutionise the world!
If you have any concerns, feel free to contact us!



<!--
**TeamInCtrl/TeamInCtrl** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
